# Relation Between Temperature and Alcohol Consumption

## Description
This project explores the relationship between local temperatures and alcohol consumption across various countries. Utilizing two datasets from "Our World in Data"â€”[Alcohol Consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption) and [Monthly Average Surface Temperatures by Year](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/monthly-average-surface-temperatures-by-year?tab=table), we process and analyze these datasets to uncover potential correlations. The analysis seeks to determine how temperature fluctuations impact alcohol intake, providing insights that could be significant for public health studies.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python along with several libraries. Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To execute the project:

    Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
    Run the Jupyter Notebook project.ipynb to see the analysis and results.

## Examples

The project includes detailed visualizations and statistical analysis, showing the correlation between temperature and alcohol consumption. The findings are summarized through correlation coefficients and scatter plots within the Jupyter notebook.
